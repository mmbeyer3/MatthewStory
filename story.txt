A knight named Nathan came from a magical kingdom. One day in the castle, a scream was heard. The Queen was missing! Nathan, the knight, searched all throughout the castle, but there was no sign of the missing Queen.
Nathan ventured outside of the castle to the training grounds.  He rallied all the new recruits to search the surrounding forest.  Nathan mounted his trusty horse and rode toward the forest in search of the missing queen. Nathan searched for 7 days and 7 nights, leading his recruits through wild miserable storms of hail and meatballs. On the last night it rained marinara with a sprinkle of oregano. Nathan watched as meatballs bounced on the tarp covering his tent and rolled into the river, hopeless. Through all of this misfortunes, the recruits were still loyal to Nathan and promised to be with him until the end. The group gathered strength and kept going on the quest to find the missing Queen. After 40 days and 40 nights of searching through countries and kingdoms, they arrived at the Himalaya. This kingdom was ruled by the most feared people known to man and it was in there where the Queen resided. She had been taken captive as a way of luring Nathan to fight in Himalaya because Himalayan rulers were jealous of Nathan's greatness and wanted to defeat him. Although they tried, Nathan ultimately came out victorious with the Queen in both hands.
