A knight named Nathan came from a magical kingdom. One day in the castle, a scream was heard. The Queen was missing! Nathan, the knight, searched all throughout the castle, but there was no sign of the missing Queen.
Nathan ventured outside of the castle to the training grounds.  He rallied all the new recruits to search the surrounding forest.  Nathan mounted his trusty horse and rode toward the forest in search of the missing queen. Nathan searched for 7 days and 7 nights, leading his recruits through wild miserable storms of hail and meatballs. On the last night it rained marinara with a sprinkle of oregano. Nathan watched as meatballs bounced on the tarp covering his tent and rolled into the river, hopeless.
